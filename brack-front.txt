To access the styling part of the cards:

-Click on any deck's name, no need to start it
-Click on the "Browse" button, above the deck's name
-Click on the "Cards" button, should be ~top right of the screen

You should see something like this

<!-- =========================================================

These two blocks go at the front and back pages,
replace fields like {{translation}}, {{srcText}}, or {{context}}
with whatever your current deck says
it might be something like {{front}} or {{main}}

When you open your deck it will by default show the
object's name you're using, you can also find it by
editing a card.

In this screenshot's case, the three fields we'd be using are:


{{Front}} which contains the word BewÃ¤ltigen,
{{Back}} which containts the approximate ~translation,

And

{{Note}} which contains an example 



<!--- Watch how in this document, the object {{Note}} is rather called {{context}}
	while the {{Back}} is called {{srcText}} -->
	
You might run into different decks that rename those fields differently
that's why I chose these examples, so you are aware of it,
if you rename it, it won't work, you must respect the field's name given by the deck


You might as well replace the {{ }} objects in the reversed cards, in case
your deck has a reversed setting too (front being hidden and back as the visible clue)

Don't forget to apply the styling, it is a different document in this repo,
	but you should edit it on that same window.
