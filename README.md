Anki template so it doesn't look as shitty

Some simple instructions are left in case anyone needs them, they're based on a simpler, older template but you can follow them and achieve the same result
>Start with the back-front.txt file right here


Added some effects, colors, overall tried to make it look less boring

These effects (movement) DO NOT work on the windows app, i don't know if there's a workaround,
  if you're using it you can simply go to the web version, they display correctly there.

  
Tested on linux and web, use preferably on and ipad or something w/ a big screen
      as this was conceived to be used on a desktop.

Don't know about macOs, I imagine it'd work, if you try them let me know

I did not code the big "images" like the astronaut or the candles
  i took them from this page and modified them a little bit so it wouldn't break the card

I know candles don't display centered, will fix it at some point, im tired and i don't like using dark mode
